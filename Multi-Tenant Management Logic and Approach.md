# Multi-Tenant Azure Management: Logic & Approach

## Project Overview

This document outlines the logical approach and methodology for managing multiple Azure tenants using Lokka MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The project enables seamless switching between different Azure organizations while maintaining security and operational efficiency.

## Business Context

### Target Tenants (Artificial Test Environment)

- **Dasein Research Group** (Primary Test Tenant) - Simulated established organization for testing mature configurations
- **Spectral Solutions** (Secondary Test Tenant) - Simulated growing organization for testing scalability patterns

**Note**: These are entirely artificial tenants created for testing and demonstration purposes. All user activities, behaviors, and organizational patterns will be driven directly through these workflows or by administrative actions to simulate realistic Microsoft 365 usage scenarios.

### Key Objectives

1. **Unified Management Interface** - Single AI model interface for multi-tenant operations testing via MCP servers
2. **Security Isolation** - Validate proper tenant separation with individual authentication
3. **Operational Efficiency** - Test tenant switching and cross-tenant comparison capabilities
4. **Audit Trail** - Demonstrate comprehensive logging of all tenant interactions
5. **Active Usage Simulation** - Generate realistic Microsoft 365 license utilization patterns for optimization testing

## Architecture & Design Philosophy

### Multi-Tenant Strategy

The approach leverages multiple Lokka MCP server instances, each configured for a specific tenant. These MCP servers can be accessed through various AI model interfaces:

**Supported Client Interfaces:**
- Claude Desktop (Anthropic)
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot Studio
- Any MCP-compatible AI model client

**MCP Server Configuration:**

```config

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Client Secret: [To be configured]
```

### Security Model

#### Principle of Least Privilege

- Each MCP server has tenant-specific application registrations
- API permissions are scoped to essential operations only
- Client secrets are isolated per tenant with appropriate expiration

##### Recommended Permission Set

- `User.Read.All` - User directory access
- `Group.Read.All` - Group and membership information
- `Application.Read.All` - Application inventory
- `Directory.Read.All` - Directory structure and configuration
- `Policy.Read.All` - Security policies and conditional access
- `AuditLog.Read.All` - Compliance and audit trail
- `Reports.Read.All` - Usage and activity reports
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All` - Intune configuration
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` - Device inventory

### Client Interface Flexibility

The MCP server architecture is designed to be platform-agnostic, supporting multiple client interfaces for maximum operational flexibility:

## Results & Insights Framework

### Microsoft 365 Active Usage Criteria

The primary business objective is to optimize license utilization by monitoring actual user engagement across Microsoft 365 workloads. Active usage is defined by specific criteria over a rolling 28-day period:

**Monitored Workloads & Active Usage Thresholds:**

- **Exchange Online**: Sent or received ‚â•1 email in rolling 28-day period
- **SharePoint Online**: Opened or interacted with ‚â•1 site/document in 28 days
- **Microsoft Teams**: Participated in a call/meeting or sent a chat message
- **Microsoft 365 Apps**: Launched an Office desktop app (Word, Excel, etc.) with licensed account
- **OneDrive**: Uploaded or modified a file
- **Intune**: Devices enrolled or compliant (device count, not user count)
- **Defender for Office 365**: Email filtered or actioned under policy
- **Viva Engage/Yammer**: Posted, liked, or reacted to content in communities

**Qualifying License Types:**

- Microsoft 365 Business Basic/Standard/Premium
- Microsoft 365 E3/E5 (and equivalents like F3)
- Office 365 E1/E3/E5
- Microsoft Teams Essentials (SMB customers)
- Microsoft 365 F1/F2 (Frontline Worker plans)

### Tenant Health Metrics

- **License Utilization Efficiency** - Active usage rates vs. assigned licenses by workload
- **Inactive License Identification** - Users not meeting active usage criteria in 28-day rolling period

## Conclusion

The multi-tenant Azure management approach using Lokka MCP servers provides a powerful, flexible foundation for unified tenant operations while maintaining security and compliance requirements. The platform-agnostic design supports multiple client interfaces, enabling teams to use their preferred tools‚Äîfrom VS Code with GitHub Copilot Studio for automation and collaboration, to Claude Desktop for natural language queries, to custom API integrations for specialized workflows.

The natural language interface significantly reduces the complexity of cross-tenant analysis and enables more effective strategic decision-making, while the automation capabilities through VS Code and GitHub integration ensure reproducible, version-controlled operations that can scale with organizational needs.

The framework is designed to accommodate various client interfaces and can easily scale beyond the initial two tenants as business requirements evolve. The emphasis on automation, team collaboration, and platform flexibility ensures continued effectiveness and alignment with modern DevOps and cloud management best practices.
